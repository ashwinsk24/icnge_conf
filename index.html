            International Conference on Novelties in Geotechnical Engineering (ICNGE
            2024) will be hosted by SCMS School of Engineering & Technology,
            Karukutty, Kerala in association with IGS Kochi Chapter. The organizing
            committee of the conference invites the original research and field case
            study papers from the researchers, academicians, and practicing
            engineers for presentation in the ICNGE 2024 during 25th and 26th April,

        <h1>INDIAN GEOTECHNICAL SOCIETY</h1>
        <p>
            The Indian National Society of Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering
            was established in the year 1948, soon after the second International
            Conference on Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering held at
            Rotterdam. The Society was affiliated to the International Society in
            the same year and since then it has strived to fulfil and promote the
            objectives of the International Society. In December 1970, the name,
            Indian Geotechnical Society (IGS) was adopted. In January 1994, it
            hosted XIII International Conference on Soil Mechanics and Foundation
            Engineering. Various Local Chapters of the IS organise annual
            conferences of the Society.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br />

        <h1>INDIAN GEOTECHNICAL SOCIETY, KOCHI CHAPTER</h1>
        <p>
            Indian Geotechnical Society Kochi Chapter was established in 2009. IGS
            Kochi Chapter enables professionals in Kerala to keep abreast of latest
            technologies by arranging technical lectures, seminars, workshops and
            site visits. The society has eminent geotechnical engineers as members
            and has grown in strength to over 400 members. In this short period, the
            chapter has been vested with the honour of hosting the prestigious
            annual conference of IGS in 2011 and 2022. Kochi Chapter also had the
            privilege of organizing successfully IGS - DFI (I), Workshop on Piling
            in 2014, Workshop on Soil Behaviour in 2015, 5th Ferroco Terzaghi
            Oration in 2016, National Symposium on Landslides in 2018 and Arvind
            Verma Memorial Lecture in 2019. The chapter has been conducting the
            annual Praphulla Kumar Lecture Series from 2012 till date.

                    <p>
                        The SCMS School of Engineering and Technology (SSET), promoted by
                        the SCMS Group of Educational Institutions, has been in the
                        forefront of providing quality professional education in
                        Engineering and Technology since 2001. The college is envisaged as
                        a premier institution offering technology-related education to
                        students with due emphasis on ethical values in preparing them to
                        meet the growing challenges of the industry and needs of the
                        society. SSET has established state of the art facilities on a
                        sprawling 29-acre campus at Karukutty in Ernakulam District. SSET
                        is one of the first ten colleges to be set up in the State under
                        the private self-financing scheme. Ever since its inception, SSET
                        has concentrated on providing quality education in a highly
                        disciplined environment. This has paid rich dividends over the
                        past years as is evident from the preference of students to join
                        the College.

        <h1>ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT</h1>
        <p>
            The Department of Civil Engineering, spearheaded with highly competent,
            well qualified and experienced faculty, has been in existence since the
            inception of SSET in 2001. The Department offers two Undergraduate
            programs in Civil Engineering and Civil & Environmental Engineering and
            two Post-graduate programs namely Computer Aided Structural Engineering
            and Environmental Engineering under APJ Abdul Kalam Technological
            University. The Department is an approved research center under KTU with
            seven full fledged laboratories supplemented with modern equipment. The
            MIKE Computational Laboratory with advanced modeling tools for water
            resources studies as an industry academic collaboration with Danish
            Hydraulic Institute is a unique facility provided by the department. The
            Department is actively engaged in testing and consultancy activities for
            various governmental as well as non-governmental organizations. MoU’s
            established with foreign universities have opened up avenues for
            faculty/student exchange programs and over the past three years, many
            faculty and students have been part of this program.
